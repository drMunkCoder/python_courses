# THIS QUESTION IS A BIT UNCLEAR                #
# HOW DOES THIS GET 2?                          #
# IF IT IS BECAUSE OF THE 2nd VALUE THEN        #
# THIS PROGRAM/QUESTION IS TOO EASY             #
# FIRST PARAM (DIRECTION) UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT    #
# DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.                           #

# Question 21
# Level 3
# Question A robot moves in a plane starting 
# from the original point (0,0). The robot 
# can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. 
# The trace of robot movement is shown as the following: 
# UP 5 DOWN 3 LEFT 3 RIGHT 2 ¡­ The numbers after the direction are steps. 
# Please write a program to compute the distance from current position 
# after a sequence of movement and original point. 
# If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer. 
# Example: If the following tuples are given as input to the program: 
# UP 5 DOWN 3 LEFT 3 RIGHT 2 Then, the output of the program should be: 2
# 
# Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, 
# it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Solution
def sol():
    # import math
    # pos = [0,0]
    # while True:
    #     s = input()
    #     if not s:
    #         break
    #     movement = s.split(" ")
    #     direction = movement[0]
    #     steps = int(movement[1])
    #     if direction=="UP":
    #         pos[0]+=steps
    #     elif direction=="DOWN":
    #         pos[0]-=steps
    #     elif direction=="LEFT":
    #         pos[1]-=steps
    #     elif direction=="RIGHT":
    #         pos[1]+=steps
    #     else:
    #         pass

    # print(int(round(math.sqrt(pos[1]**2+pos[0]**2))))
